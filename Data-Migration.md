## How to Plan A Data Migration
Extract data -> Transform data -> Load data

## 7步迁移策略(7-phase processes)
|步骤|动作|描述
|:-|:-|:-
|1|Premigration planning|Evaluate the data being moved for stability.
|2|Project initiation|Identify and brief key stakeholders.
|3|Landscape analysis| Establish a robust data quality rules management process and brief the business on the goals of the project, including shutting down legacy systems.
|4|Solution design| Determine what data to move, and the quality of that data before and after the move.
|5|Build & test| Code the migration logic and test the migration with a mirror of the production environment.
|6|Execute & validate| Demonstrate that the migration has complied with requirements and that the data moved is viable for business use.
|7|Decommission & monitor| Shut down and dispose of old systems.
  
## 迁移挑战
|编号|面临的挑战
|:-|:-
|1|**Not contacting key stakeholders** No matter the size of the migration, there is someone, somewhere who cares about the data you’re moving. Track them down and explain the need for this project and the impact on them before you get going on the task. If you don’t, you’ll certainly hear from them at some stage, and chances are good that they’ll disrupt your timeline.
|2|**Not communicating with the business** Once you’ve explained the project to the stakeholders, be sure to keep them informed of your progress. It’s best to provide a status report on the same day every week, especially if things get off track. Regular communication goes a long way in building trust with all those affected.
|3|**Lack of data governance** Be sure you’re clear on who has the rights to create, approve, edit, or remove data from the source system, and document that in writing as part of your project plan.
|4|**Lack of expertise** Although this is a straightforward task, there's a lot of complexity involved in moving data. Having an experienced professional with excellent references helps the process go smoothly.
|5|**Lack of planning** On average, families spend 10 to 20 hours planning their vacation, while IT teams may spend as little as half that time planning a small data migration. Hours spent planning don't always guarantee success but having a solid data migration plan does save hours when it comes to actually moving the data.
|6|**Insufficient data prep software and skills** If this is a large migration (millions of records or hundreds of tables), invest in first-class data quality software and consider hiring a specialist firm to assist. Good news: An outside firm will probably rent you the software to help conserve costs.
|7|**Waiting for perfect specs for the target** If the implementation team is sorting out design criteria, press on with steps 2 and 3. Target readiness will matter later in the project, but don’t let it stop you now.
|8|**Unproven migration methodology** Do some research to be sure that the data movement procedure has worked well for other firms like yours. Resist the temptation to just accept the generic procedure offered by a vendor.
|9|**Supplier and project management** Vendors and projects must be managed. If you're still doing your day job too, be sure that you have the time to manage the project and any related suppliers.
|10|**Cross-object dependencies** With the technology and capabilities of data management tools available today, it's still shocking to learn about a dependent dataset that wasn’t included in the original plan. Because cross-object dependencies often are not discovered until very late in the migration process, be sure to build in a contingency for them so that your entire delivery date isn’t thrown off.
