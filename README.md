# About the past work
At school, I studied electronics and quantum machanics, and published several papers about computational materials.  
> (1) [Enhanced Magnetic Anisotropies of Single Transition-Metal Adatoms on a Defective MoS2 Monolayer](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09361)  
> **Master's Thesis:** [Research and Application of Dopants and Vacancy in Low Dimensional Materials](http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10269-1015345586.htm)  
 
> (2) I was honored to be selected as a special research student to do research at Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.

[Angewandte Chemie](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2083236860_Weitao_Cong)  

After graduation, I joined Sugon as an HPC solution engineer, responsible for HPC cluster soluton design, delivery and performance tuning. Through three years' work, I quickly mastered knowledge of high-end technology of servers, Infiniband, and storage,etc., as well as Lustre filesystem, PBS, Slurm and HPC related technics.   
> **(A).** [Major contribution to the data center building for the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_hundred_meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope), consists of 30TFlops of compute and 3PB of storage.  
> **(B).** At Sugon, I almost completed 50+ projects independently, and quite good at performance tuning of HPC applications.  
   I also obtained a patent about the health check for large-scale cluster, [**Patent NO : CN107766204A**].

Since 2018.10 I joined Huawei, responsible for the reference architecture (RA) of software-defined storage, including Lustre, Ceph(Red Hat Ceph,SuSe Enterprise Storage), IBM COS, Scality and other kinds of object storage, as well as the marketing development of the processors of Huawei Kunpeng and Ascend.  
> 2018.10 - 2019.3  Responsible for the Openstack based virtualization, and the Ceph based storage solution design and performance tuning on Huawei server products.  
> 2020.3 - 2021.12  Responsible for the marketing development of Huawei Kunpeng and Ascend processors.
