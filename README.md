### On OpenStack
[Backup Solution-Raksha](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Raksha#VM_Backup)  

### On Data Science
I begin to study data science because I believe that the value behind data is much more important than the infrastructures.
I agree that data will be the most important assets of all enterprises in the future, and knowing data will be the critical task in moving forward of Industry 4.0.

# About the past work
At school, I'm interested in quantum machanics and published several papers about computational materials.  
> (1) [Enhanced Magnetic Anisotropies of Single Transition-Metal Adatoms on a Defective MoS2 Monolayer](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09361)  
> **Master's Thesis:** [Research and Application of Dopants and Vacancy in Low Dimensional Materials](http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10269-1015345586.htm)  
 
> (2) I was honored to be selected as a special research student to do research at Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.
[Advanced Materials](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2083236860_Weitao_Cong)  
[Angewandte Chemie](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2083236860_Weitao_Cong)  

Since graduation, I joined Sugon as an HPC solution engineer, responsible for HPC cluster soluton design, delivery and performance tuning. Through hard work, I quickly mastered knowledge of high-end technology of servers, Infiniband, and storage,etc., as well as Lustre filesystem, PBS, Slurm and HPC related softwares.   
> **(A).** [Major contribution to the data center building for the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_hundred_meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope), consists of 30TFlops of compute and 3PB of storage.  
> **(B).** At Sugon, I almost completed 50+ projects independently, and quite good at performance tuning of HPC applications.  
   I also obtained a patent about the health check for large-scale cluster, [**Patent NO : CN107766204A**].

Three years later I joined Huawei, responsible for the reference architecture of software-defined storage, including Lustre, Ceph(Red Hat Ceph,SuSe Enterprise Storage), IBM COS, Scality and other kinds of object storage.
