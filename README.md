# On Data Science
I begin to study data science because I believe that the value behind data is much more important than the infrastructures.
I agree that data will be the most important assets of all enterprises in the future, and knowing data will be the critical task in the movement of Industry 4.0.

# About the past work
Long time ago have I been thinking about building a personal blog to record my journey in the area of computer science, finally it comes true.

(1) As a master student at East China Normal University, I focused on the spintonic semiconductor materials simulations for the application of magnectic storage, and published a master thesis work [Enhanced Magnetic Anisotropies of Single Transition-Metal Adatoms on a Defective MoS2 Monolayer](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09361)

(2) As a special research student at Tohoku University, I did some calculations of novel electrochemical materials, and published with co-works,

[Advanced Materials](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2083236860_Weitao_Cong)

[Angewandte Chemie](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2083236860_Weitao_Cong)

(3) When I finished the master degree, I joined Sugon as a HPC Solution Engineer, responsible for the cluster design, delivery and performanc tuning. From then, I enterd the field of computing. Projects I have been involved includes,

a. [Data Center Construction for the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope - Major Contributor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_hundred_meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope)

b. Independently responsible for the Lustre Storage Solutions for HPC and AI

(4) Now I'm joining Huawei as a software engineer, responsible for the reference architecture of software-defined storage, including Lustre, Ceph(Red Hat Ceph,SuSe Enterprise Storage), IBM COS, Scality and other kinds of object storage.
